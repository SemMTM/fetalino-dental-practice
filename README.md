## Bugs

### Fixed bugs

After deployment of the project, the logo in the header was not loading. This was because I used an absolute file path instead of a relative one. 

Another image on the home page was not loading because the file name had some characters that did not match the exact file name. I just reselected the image and the file name was corrected.

### Unfixed Bugs

- No bugs on the deployed page.
